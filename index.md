## My Shiny App: Word Predictor

It predicts the next word the user about to type in based on preceeding words and a statistical model that was trained on data sets from twitter and news blogs.
You can find my useful Shiny data product at: https://andraspap.shinyapps.io/NLP-Demo-Project/ 
The training data can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip

Give it a try!!
